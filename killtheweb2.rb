# After some experimentation, 12 forks seems to be optimal. Much more runs up the load on the dyno and
# just slows the entire thing down.
# Needs a little bit more testing, and it should settle between 12 and 14 forks.
# I need to normalize away differences in dyno performance by running multi-dyno tests
# I've seen some very stark differences between dynos (~ 1000 RPM differences in performance)
