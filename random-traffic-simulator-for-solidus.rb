# This script is intended to simulate traffic against this example Solidus app: 
# https://github.com/SandyPantsLai/rails-pg-example-shop
# GET requests will be made against your TARGETS config var
# In addition, POST requests will be made against random products in the Solidus store to add those items to the cart

# This will run tests with random delays between each request.
# It will also ramp up RPS during certain hours and ramp down others to simulate load peaks
# It's best to run this in continuous mode
